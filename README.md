## Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Signal Processing Sample application! This tool serves as a hands-on introduction to digital signal processing (DSP). Whether you're a student, a researcher, or a developer looking to understand the fundamentals of DSP, this sample application provides you with practical examples and interactive tools to explore signal processing concepts.

Digital Signal Processing Sample offers an intuitive and interactive environment to experiment with various DSP techniques, filter designs, and signal analysis. You can use it for learning, prototyping, or as a reference for DSP-related projects.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Generate various types of signals, including sine waves, square waves, and custom signals.

- **Filter Design**: Design and apply digital filters, such as FIR and IIR filters, to process signals.

- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize signals, filter responses, and spectra in real-time with interactive plots.

- **Signal Analysis**: Analyze signal properties, such as frequency content, amplitude, and phase.

- **Export and Share**: Save processed signals and analysis results for further study or integration into other projects.
